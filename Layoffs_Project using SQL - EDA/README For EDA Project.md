# Project Overview

The goal of the Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) phase is to identify trends, patterns, and key insights from the layoffs dataset. By analyzing the data across various dimensions, we aim to gain a deeper understanding of layoffs, including their frequency, industry distribution, and geographical patterns over time.

---

## Objectives

- Identify key trends in layoffs over time, across different industries, locations, and company stages.
- Highlight the companies, industries, or regions experiencing the most layoffs.
- Investigate unusual or outlier events to better understand the data and the reasons behind significant layoffs.

## Key Insights

### 1. Top Companies and Layoffs
- **Largest Layoff Events**: Identified the companies with the highest number of employees laid off in a single event.
- **Total Layoffs by Company**: Highlighted the companies with the highest total layoffs over the dataset period.

### 2. Geographical Trends
- **Locations with the Most Layoffs**: Analyzed cities and countries that experienced the highest number of layoffs.
- **Regional Trends**: Assessed layoffs by country to explore regional patterns and distributions.

### 3. Industry-Wise Analysis
- **Layoffs by Industry**: Investigated which industries were most affected by layoffs, shedding light on economic struggles faced by particular sectors.
- **Impact on Startups**: Found that startups, particularly those in early stages, were heavily impacted, with some laying off their entire workforce.

### 4. Time-Based Analysis
- **Yearly Trends**: Analyzed layoffs by year to observe patterns and link them to broader economic conditions that affected employment.
- **Monthly Rolling Totals**: Calculated rolling totals of layoffs over time to identify significant peaks and dips.

### 5. Company Stages
- Evaluated layoffs based on company stage (e.g., startup, growth, enterprise) to determine which types of companies were most vulnerable to layoffs.

## Highlights and Observations

- Some well-funded startups, such as Quibi and BritishVolt, experienced complete shutdowns despite having substantial financial backing.
- The tech industry experienced significant layoffs, often due to market corrections and shifting priorities.
- The United States had a higher number of layoffs compared to other countries, which aligns with its large share of the global workforce and tech industry presence.
