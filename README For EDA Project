Project Overview
The EDA phase aims to uncover trends, patterns, and insights from the layoffs dataset. By analyzing key metrics, we gain a deeper understanding of the scope and nature of layoffs across industries, companies, and countries over time.

Objectives
Identify significant trends in layoffs across time, industries, locations, and company stages.
Highlight companies, industries, or regions with the highest layoffs.
Investigate interesting patterns, such as outliers or unusual layoffs, to better understand the dataset.

Key Insights
1. Top Companies and Layoffs
Largest Single Layoff Events: Identified companies with the highest number of employees laid off in a single event.
Total Layoffs by Company: Highlighted companies with the most layoffs over the dataset's timeframe.

2. Geographical Trends
Locations with the Highest Layoffs: Analyzed which cities and countries experienced the largest layoffs.
Regional Insights: Evaluated the total layoffs per country and observed trends by geographic distribution.

3. Industry-Wise Analysis
Layoffs by Industry: Determined industries with the most layoffs, providing insights into economic and market challenges faced by specific sectors.
Impact on Startups: Noted that early-stage companies, particularly startups, were significantly impacted, with some laying off 100% of their workforce.

4. Time-Based Analysis
Yearly Trends: Examined layoffs per year to understand temporal patterns and economic conditions affecting employment.
Monthly Rolling Totals: Computed rolling totals of layoffs over time to observe peaks and troughs.

5. Company Stages
Assessed layoffs by company stage (e.g., startup, growth-stage, enterprise) to identify which types of companies were most affected.

Highlights and Observations
Some startups with substantial funding (e.g., Quibi, BritishVolt) experienced complete shutdowns despite significant financial backing.
The tech industry faced notable layoffs, often influenced by market corrections and shifting priorities.
Geographically, the United States experienced a substantial number of layoffs compared to other countries, consistent with its share of global workforce and tech industry presence.
